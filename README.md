# MingMing and Friends

Help Mingming reach home. The journey towards her home is a very tough one! Mingming has to go through different places so that she could be reunited with her family. These places get more difficult to go through as Mingming becomes nearer to her home! But worry not, Mingming meets her friends along the way who can help her go home.

## Goal of the Game

In every level, Mingming has to reach 0 distance which simply means that she is nearing the next town while on the way home! She has to be careful though, because different obstacles are coming for her way, waiting to decrease a cat's 9 lives! :scream_cat:
